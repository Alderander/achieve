PMMP has support for player achievements, but no way to see what achievements you have earned! This plugin adds two simple commands for listing your achievements. NOTE: There is already a list for XBox achievements, but those are unobtainable on a PMMP server. This plugin allows you to list your PMMP specific achievements.

* /achieve - lists your achievements
* /achieve \<player\> - lists a players achievements

The list will show an overall count (ex: 2/11 achievements) as well as a list of every achievement available in a certain color. The color breakdown is as follows:

* green - You have completed this achievement
* white - You can complete this achievement now
* gray - You must complete a different achievement (shown next to achievement name) before completing this achievement

PMMP only has 11 achievements at the moment, so I will probably continue to update this plugin with the missing achievements ("Taking Inventory", "The End?", etc.) to match the XBox/Java lists
